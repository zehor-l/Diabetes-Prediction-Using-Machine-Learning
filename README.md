#Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning 🩺🤖
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical data such as blood glucose levels, BMI, and other health indicators. The goal is to create an efficient predictive system using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

##Project Overview 🎯
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for preventing serious complications. This project uses a supervised machine learning approach to predict diabetes based on various health metrics.

##Features 📊
Medical Data Input: Utilizes health indicators like glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, etc.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): The core machine learning algorithm used to classify diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps like handling missing data, feature scaling, and data standardization.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s accuracy on both training and testing datasets.

####All steps of the project, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, are thoroughly explained in the accompanying Google Colab notebook. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the code file.
